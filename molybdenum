-[ Molybdenum ]-[ Atomic number: 42 ]-[ Chemical symbol: Mo ]-

Molybdenum has been known throughout history, though its properties meant that
it was confused with lead ores. It was first identified as a distinct element
in 1778, meaning our modern understanding of its existence reaches about as far
back as American independence.

Molybdenum has a very high melting point, 2623Â°C, the fifth highest temperature
of any element. While pure molybdenum is only about as strong as tooth enamel,
it forms strong alloys that are resistant to corrosion and stable under varying
temperature.

As a result, these alloys are used for metal armour plates, high-performance
aircraft parts, and pumps for molten metal flows.  In its elemental form, it
can be used as a fertiliser, and the isotope molybdenum-99 is used as a source
of technetium-99m, an important medical radioisotope used for 3D bone scans and
the investigation of blood flow when diagnosing heart disease.
