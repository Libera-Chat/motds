Mercury
Atomic number: 80
Chemical symbol: Hg

Known since antiquity, Mercury is a heavy, liquid metal element at room
temperature - the only such element. Despite its wide range of uses, mercury is
a relatively rare element, though this is mitigated by its ore deposits tending
to be highly concentrated.

The uses of mercury include medical applications such as dental amalgams,
topical antiseptic compounds, and blood pressure meters. Outside of medicine,
mercury can be found in telescopes to form flat mirror surfaces, as well as
parabolic surfaces when their container is spun. Mercury has historically and
continues to be used in many other industries and applications.
