-[ Manganese ]-[ Atomic number: 25 ]-[ Chemical symbol: Mn ]-

Manganese is a brittle transition metal first isolated in 1774, around the time
of American Independence. Alongside a number of industrial roles, particularly
in stainless steel production, it is also known to be used in many biological
functions. One such instance is in the Oxygen-evolving complex, the mechanism
where plants develop oxygen during photosynthesis. While manganese is an
essential element for biological functions, overdose and toxicity are serious
and long-lasting.

In industry, it is used to improve the workability and strength of steel.
Additionally, it is used in gasoline additives to raise the octane rating and
reduce engine knocking. Manganese is also used in minting, with a number of
coins using silver/manganese blends in place of nickel, which is often more
expensive or difficult to come by, given nickel's broader industrial use.
